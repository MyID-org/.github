# MyID - Your new secure identity.

In today's fast-paced world, one grave mistake that most of us make is to share our phone numbers/email addresses with everyone without giving a second thought, including with people whom we don't know or organizations that we don't trust.

Did you know that with just your phone number, one can extract a lot of your other personal information like addresses, occupations, etc.? And as we all know, sharing our personal email addresses obviously leads to a lot of spam messages (Hate them so much!)

So what if there was another identity for yourself (something as simple as a random ID like I2314) which could be shared instead of your phone number or email ID?

There can be an app that can generate random IDs as an alternate identity for us to share with ones whom we don't trust. And they can use this ID to interact with us in various ways (messages, polls, etc. The scope is huge!)
